        <br/>mechanics, DIY projects, learning to cook new exciting meals and 
        <br/>gardening. I would say those are amoung my top favourite hobbies I

        I have been a mechanical engineer for 15 years now and have finally
        <br/>taken a step forward to becoming a software engineer. Programming
        <br/> has always been the one that got away and I have come back in full
        <br/> force to get where I want to be.
